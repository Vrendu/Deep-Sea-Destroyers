# Deep-Sea-Destroyers

Background:

The oppressive imperialist Atlantis regime is sending an army to take over our quaint underwater city. The user will get to pick from a selection of battleships and face the oncoming attackers, shooting at them while also avoiding getting shot at by them. The game will keep track of total score, number of lives, and have the ability to increase levels. 


Functionality & MVPs

In Deep Sea Destroyers, users will be able to:

- choose from a selection of battleships
- use the keyboard to move ship freely and shoot projectiles to kill enemy ships
- level up and gain more powerful projectiles, but face more powerful enemies
- turn music on or off


In addition, this project will include:

- wireframe of basic game layout
- credits and inspirations 

For now, only planning to use Canvas API for this project, may change with time. 

Implementation Timeline:

- Friday Afternoon & Weekend - implement basic game logic and functionality
- Monday - implementing leveling up functionality, some of the graphics, maybe the sound
- Tuesday - nailing down the graphics of the game
- Wednesday - Final touches
- Thursday Morning - should be finished by this time
